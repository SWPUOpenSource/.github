## Introduction

The Open Source Association affiliated with Southwest Petroleum University (SWPU) is a student-initiated open-source community at SWPU. We are dedicated to promoting the spirit of the free software movement, advocating open-source software, developing open-source projects, and fostering the growth of the open-source community. Our main activities include hosting open-source salons, conferences, training sessions, competitions, promoting open-source software, participating in open-source project development, sharing open-source experiences, and organizing open-source events.

## Organizational Structure

- **Board of Directors**: The governing body of the association, elected from core contributors, responsible for all aspects of the association, including organizing meetings, hosting events, managing resources, and overseeing association affairs.
- **Publicity Committee**: Comprised of association members and accountable to the Board. The committee is responsible for publicity and promotion, strategizing promotional activities, and collaborating with school and enterprises.
- **Core Developers**: Core contributors from within the association responsible for developing, maintaining, and operating the association's open-source projects.
- **Contributors**: Developers who contribute to the association and related projects and have their contributions merged. Long-term contributors can be nominated by the Board and, upon election, become core developers.
